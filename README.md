# Project-02 How Does GDP Change By Region and What Industries Are More Commonly Associated With Higher GDP (1997-2017)
## Description
We attempted to visualize the growth/decline of GDP over a twenty year span, with a specific focus on the GDP-based performance of different industries in their respective states. We scraped the data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, official US Gov. website: https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/index_regional.cfm, and used that dataset as the basis for our visualization.
